        There once lived a man and his wife, who had long wished for a child,
        but in vain. Now there was at the back of their house a little window
        which overlooked a beautiful garden full of the finest vegetables and
        flowers; but there was a high wall all round it, and no one ventured
        into it, for it belonged to a witch of great might, and of whom all
        the world was afraid. <br>
        One day, when the wife was standing at the win-
        dow, and looking into the garden, she saw a bed filled with the finest
        rampion; and it looked so fresh and green that she began to wish for
        some; and at length she longed for it greatly.
